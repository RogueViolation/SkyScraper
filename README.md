# SkyScraper
Since Lithuanian stocks of new 30 series NVidia GPUs were non-existant I decided to write a web scraper to automatically update me whenever the price/stock changes.

Just get some stock pls come on. It really shows that I am not commited to pressing F5 every once in a while on a website.
